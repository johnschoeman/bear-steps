# Getting Started with Air Steps

<p class="subtitle"><em>Your guide to safely beginning your air steps journey.</em></p>

Air steps are an exciting and expressive part of partner dancing. This guide will help you understand what air steps are, how to get started safely, and what to expect on your learning journey.

## Important!

*Do not attempt any weight sharing move, lift, or air step without getting verbal consent from you partner first. This includes supported dips!*

*Do not do lifts, supported dips, or air steps on the social dance floor.*

*Trust us, you do not want to be that person that hurts someone while dancing.*

## What Are Air Steps?

Air steps are partner dance movements where one or both dancers' feet leave the ground. They range from simple lifts and dips to complex aerial maneuvers. Air steps add dramatic flair to performances and competitions, but they require proper training, preparation, and safety practices.

### Common Types of Air Steps

- **Basic Lifts:** Simple vertical lifts where the flyer's feet briefly leave the ground
- **Dips:** Supported movements where the flyer is lowered toward the floor
- **Throws:** More dynamic movements involving horizontal or rotational motion
- **Advanced Aerials:** Complex multi-rotation or high-flying movements

## Before You Start

### Prerequisites

Before attempting air steps, you should:

- Have solid foundational partner dancing skills
- Be comfortable with basic partnering techniques
- Understand connection, leading, and following principles
- Have developed good balance and body awareness
