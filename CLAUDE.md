# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a minimal repository containing only an empty HTML file (`index.html`). The repository appears to be in the early stages of development with no established build system, dependencies, or project structure yet.

## Current State

- **Language/Framework**: Static HTML (potential web project)
- **Build System**: None configured
- **Dependencies**: None
- **Testing**: Not configured
- **Linting**: Not configured

## Development Commands

Since this is a minimal setup with no package.json or build configuration:

- **Serve locally**: Use any static file server (e.g., `python -m http.server` or `npx serve .`)
- **No build process**: Static HTML file can be opened directly in browser
- **No tests**: Testing framework not yet established
- **No linting**: Linting tools not yet configured

## Architecture

Currently a single empty HTML file with no established architecture. When adding functionality, consider:

- Whether this will be a static site, SPA, or server-rendered application
- Build tooling needs (bundler, preprocessors, etc.)
- Testing strategy
- Code organization patterns

## Next Steps for Development

When expanding this codebase, establish:
1. Project type and framework choice
2. Package management (npm/yarn if JavaScript, etc.)
3. Build and development workflow
4. Code organization structure
